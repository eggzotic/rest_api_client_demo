# REST API Client demo

Simple REST API Client demo using package from pub.dev `rest_api_client`. This app shows a problem where `rest_api_client` fails to initialise on web platform, when the web-server is not 127.0.0.1. It would be great to solve this issue, as the package is otherwise very nice to use. However this problem prevents it from being usable in a production scenario.

## What works

- `flutter run -d chrome`
- `flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname 127.0.0.1 --web-port 8001`

as evidenced by reaching progress of `afterInit` at <http://127.0.0.1:8001>

## What doesn't work

- `flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname 192.168.86.23 --web-port 8001`

as evidenced by progress halting at `afterAssign` at <http://192.168.86.23:8001> (replace that IP number with your LAN IP - or deploy to any real web-server and point your browser at it). This shows that the instance `.init()` call is not completing.

## What we know so far

In the Chrome Javascript console we see this in the successful case:

```Got object store box in database ___rest_api_client:storage_repository.
dart_sdk.js:29464 Got object store box in database ___rest_api_client:cached_storage_repository.```

Whereas in the failed case we see:

```Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'generateKey')
